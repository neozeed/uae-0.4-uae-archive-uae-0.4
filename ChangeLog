960203 filesys.c, action_read(): Slightly more efficient code (translate Amiga
       address to real pointer).
       Moved some common code in the generate_* functions in gencpu.c to a
       separate function.
960202 Added an experimental fast disk option. Currently turned off by
       default (it's not such a big win).
       Attached sprite fixes (overlapping att. sprites looked bad, Katakis).
       Add sleep(1) before resetting the console to text mode when using
       SVGAlib: this might fix some screen corruption problems.
       Add sprite/playfield priority checking to the most important case
       (single playfield, no HAM).
       In filesys.c, do_find(): open() returns -1 on error, not zero.
       Return ERROR_OBJECT_WRONG_TYPE if do_find() is called for a directory
       (fixes Champions of Krynn harddisk installation).
960201 Don't abort if sound driver not present, just set produce_sound to 0.
       New files keybuf.c and keybuf.h to record keypresses in the right
       order and without losing any. In cia.c, force 15 scanlines between
       keypresses, just to be sure.
       unixfs.device _does_ work with Kick 1.3: just don't trust what Kick 1.3 
       sends in the startup packet. For now, disable more than one mount per 
       command line.
       Started integrating Ernesto's new Mac sources.
       Remove superfluous includes from some files.
960131 Added Ed's unixfs.device (great stuff).
       Adding ULONGs to pointers is a bad idea on the Alpha if the ULONG value
       really is signed. Add some casts to LONG in (pc_p + src) expressions
       in genpu.c.
       If DMACON is written and copper DMA is enabled, do a COPJMP1 at once.
       Helps the "Interference" demo.
960129 More SGI fixes from Ed. Bugfixes and transdisk improvements from Marcus 
       Sundberg.
       Remove EXTRA_DEFINES from Makefile. Breaks some systems.
       Move common sprite code from pfield_doline() and pfield_doline_slow()
       to new function pfield_sprite(). The same sprite may appear more than
       once on the same line, so don't shift out the bits of sprdata[] and
       sprdatb[] while displaying it (Turrican I).
       In xwin.c and svga.c, barf if LINUX_SVGALIB doesn't match the file 
       being compiled.
       Make all .o files depend on config.h in the Makefile.
       No need to exit if sound driver unavailable, but -S given.
       Small debugger fix: Missing space in output.
       Fix for the sprite logic: Specifically, use a state variable indicating
       whether the sprite has been restarted after a VSYNC. Fixes most
       Turrican problems.
960124 Added Denis Sablic's patch for sound run-time option.
       Added Ed Hanway's patch for better Makefile, X mouse cursor blanking 
       and more SGI compilation fixes.
960123 Include options.h everywhere.
       Handle 8 bit GrayScale visuals like PseudoColor.
       Remove C++ leftovers from joystick code.
960122 When using the joystick driver, the button test must come after
       handle_events() in vsync_handler().
960118 Removed all the remaining C++ comments. Changed all inline keywords to
       __inline__. Define __inline__ if not using gcc.
       Make proper prototypes for everything. Compile with maximum warnings +
       -ansi + -pedantic.
       Remove CIA_cycle(), obsolete.
       Reimplemented the STOP optimization in newcpu.c. Removed DualCPU
       support in CPU emulator.
       Real nasty bug in pfield_doline() fixed: sprxpos could be evaluated as
       negative, with not-so-amusing results. (Need to rewrite this in 
       Oberon to get array bounds checking :-)       
960117 Heroic effort: Rewrote the thing in C. This might help fix some
       problems with users being unable to compile it.
       Fixed a problem in hsync_handler(): Only call flush_line() for lines
       in the display window, i.e. when we did a prepare_line() before.
       Better code for relative branches: Don't use setpc(getpc()+x) calls,
       increment regs.pc_p instead.
960116 Reimplemented the function to load the Kickstart ROM. Use stdio instead
       of fstreams since this apparently does not work on the Mac. Detect 256K
       Kickstarts. Detect corrupt ROM images (calculate checksum).
       Added Ernesto Corvi's Mac port. Changed it around a bit, so it
       probably won't compile.
960115 Reinstate config.h options for X screen depth, so that DrawPixel() can
       be inlined in custom.cc for speed. xlinebuffer is now incremented in
       each call to DrawPixel() (for both X and SVGAlib) to get rid of some
       address calculations.
960114 Fixed X generic pixel drawing routine for SHM.
       Still trying to fix the harddisk emulation.
       uae.device no longer breaks the debugger (can step through uae.device
       functions now)
       Bugs affecting performance: SPCFLAG_STOP never got reset, and DSKLEN() 
       would set SPCFLAG_DISK even if DMA was being turned off.
       Made slow memory a run-time option.
       Defer interrupts by one CPU instruction to give programs a chance to
       read INTREQR ("Seeing is Believing" and "Substance" demos)
       Added ScrollLock hack for X, too.
960113 SVGAlib version compiles again. Fixed SVGAlib mouse bug.
       Fixed SHM bug: Maximum scanline is 313, not 312.
       Sometimes, disk.cc missed a side change and would read the wrong data.
       Fixed. Apparently, this was the worst compatibility problem.
       Implemented trace mode.
960112 Changed layout of class amigamemory a little so that gcc can generate
       better addressing modes.
       Finally wrote functions in gencpu to generate MOVEMs.
960109 Integrated Ed Hanway's patches for better X support and run-time
       configuration of some options. 
       Got rid of the direct VGA memory access. (Need to do this differently).
       Changed the method of drawing lines: custom.cc now tells the graphics
       code the line number and whether it needs to be doubleed before drawing
       it.
       Added Andre Beck's MIT-SHM patch.
       Remove warnings for newcpu.cc.
960108 Fixed exceptions in op_illg(): Need to decrement PC.
960107 Added an "uae.device" resident module at 0xF00000. This emulates a hard
       disk (fixed size 8MB for now).
960106 Moved some common code from pfield_doline() and pfield_doline_slow() to
       a separate function. This fixes a potential HAM bug (two static vars
       for the same value).
       Sound support for Linux. Works only with graphics off and the CPU
       slowed down.
       Better SVGAlib keyboard support.
960105 Added AvailMem(), AllocMem(), AllocAbs() and FreeMem() dummies.
       The Hardwired demo times the multiplication instructions and prints
       "This demo don't like Axel" if they are too fast. Apparently, Axel has
       a 68040. Added a WANT_SLOW_MULTIPLY option to config.h.
       Fixed the fast blitter emulation (seems to work now).
960104 Fixed all the ChangeLog entries from 95 that said 96 (oops??!)
       pfield_may_need_update() should check whether bitplane DMA is on.
       Added ersatz.cc and ersatz.h. The purpose of these files is to
       implement one or two Kickstart functions that are commonly called from
       bootblocks. This should help support some games and demos that only use
       the Kickstart as an initial track loader. So far, it's only good enough
       for one program.
951223 More intelligent event handling in the CPU emulator. Slightly faster.
951222 Optimize CPU emulation by inlining cctrue(). Also, the real PC no
       longer needs to be incremented each instruction. The real PC value
       now has to be fetched by m68k_getpc().
       Added direct screen access for SVGAlib, but it didn't help much. I'll
       probably remove it again.
       The gencpu executable is 2M smaller if it allocates memory
       dynamically.
951216 custom_bput() enhanced a little. Now remembers the value that was 
       written in the other half of the register.
       Apparently, the USEx bits of BLTCON0 are ignored in line draw mode.
       (Silents-Demo)

951212 Release 0.3
951212 Included Alessandro's battclock patch.
       Fixed mouse autocalibration for wrong-aspect screens.
951210 Joystick support for Linux.
       Better color matching for 256 color modes.
       Rewrote most of the memory management in plain C, mainly to avoid the
       various template bugs in some compilers, but also because gcc can't
       handle the regparm attribute for virtual functions yet.
951209 Added Alessandro's patches for automatic mouse calibration.
       Tried to optimize the blitter loop a bit. Doesn't work.
951205 Added Hannu's patches for diskfile write support.
951201 More portability fixes, especially for weird compilers that workstation
       vendors ship.
951125 More keys for X, some keyboard support for SVGAlib (slightly 
       dangerous); beginnings of US keyboard support.
951124 256 color mode support for SVGAlib. FAST!
951123 Tiny tweak to central loops in playfield code results in much better
       assembly. Apparently, GCC does not feel too good about optimizing 
       reference variables.
951113 Bug fix in the events code (nextevent must not be changed while events
       are being processed).
951112 The playfield can now be drawn with the right aspect (i.e., every line
       twice). Slower, but looks nicer and supports interlaced mode
       (flickerfree!). The first 29 lines (blanking interval) are omitted
       now to fit everything in 800x600.
       Oops, disk drive identification did not work. Fixed, all four drives
       appear now.
       Oops, CIA_reset() was there all the time but never got called.
       Optimized the planar->chunky conversion in pfield_doline() a little.
       This really is time critical.
951111 If colors change on a line, we might still be able to use the full 
       line update, if the change occurred outside the DIW. Have to be a 
       little careful, though.
       Playfield code now uses real pointers again, but makes sure it can
       read enough bytes to complete the current line without segfaulting.
       Oops, my "better estimate" (see below) was a mistake. Restored the
       original 4 hw cycles per instruction relation. This slows down the
       emulator while booting (more screen refreshs), but speeds up many
       demos that otherwise spend most of their time waiting for a specific
       raster position.
       Playfield modulos must be added immediately when DDF stops. (WOC demo)
       Portability fixes in disk.cc (null pointers).
       Implemented average frame rate calculation ('c' in the debugger).
       Debugger fixes.
       Sprite fixes (height was wrong, wrong priorities in fast update)
       Added an AutoConfig expansion RAM device. The OS seems to recognize
       it, but breaks sometime later (seems to be the same bug that kills
       the emulator when there's RAM at 0xC00000).
       SVGAlib now has mouse support, too.
       HAM mode implemented.
951110 Implemented fast complete line playfield update. Switches back if
       necessary. Fixed attached sprites bug.
       Copper wait no longer slows down the CPU emulation. (there were
       lots of new copper bugs because of this, but I hope I fixed all
       of them).
       Changed cia?t? from UWORD to ULONG, since there were overflows in
       the assertion (because of 65535+1 == 0).
951108 The DIVS remainder could have the wrong sign.
       New HAVE_BROKEN_SOFTWARE define in config.h that makes the emulator
       mask out the high byte of all addresses.
       Wrote genblitter.cc and replaced the awful code in blitter_blit()
       and blitter_line() with calls to the generated function.
951107 Implemented ?BCD. These don't really work yet.

951106 Release 0.2
951105 Fixed a bug in the new CIA timer code.
       Fixed flag settings for some cases of ADDX/SUBX
951104 Changed the main loop a bit - call all the *cycle() functions only if
       it is really necessary. I hope everything still works - at least it is
       twice as fast now :-D
       Improved mouse emulation - avoid overflows, permit "wraparound".
       Added debugger 'g' command.
       Removed some useless casts from the CPU emulator.
       Added a configuration option to prevent checks for odd addresses. Only
       very bad programs need this check.
951103 The sprite emulation sometimes did not work too well, especially with
       dual playfield mode. Hopefully fixed.
951102 The 10 cycle counter is more like a 5 cycle counter in this
       implementation. (Fine, that makes floppy loading even faster :-)
       Implemented mouse movement. Totally out of sync with the X pointer,
       but at least something.
       Found out about the XAutoRepeatOff() function. Real useful.
       DualCPU mode works again.
       Corrected flag settings for CMPA.W.
       Fixed DIV instructions: Don't change dest in case of overflow.
951031 The PC is now converted to a real pointer. This is safe (much safer
       than converting bitplane pointers, since the PC always has to be valid)
       and should speed things up a little.
951029 Some primitive event handling: 2 mouse buttons and 1 joystick button
       are emulated, as well as parts of the keyboard (only german mapping).
       Fixes: Delay values and sprite widths are always LoRes. Playfield 2
       uses colors 9..15.
       Implemented a frame rate configuration option that can speed up the
       emulation quite a bit.
951028 A-ha. The 68000 has one strange feature after all. MOVEM.W to Dn sign 
       extends the value to a longword.
       Katakis expects that accessing odd addresses causes exception 3, so 
       we have to emulate this. *Sigh*
       Do at least something with the index pulse bit. It's more or less a 
       toggle now.
       Implemented sprites & dual playfields, both with small glitches.
951027 When LOF is set, the frame is one line longer.
951026 Implemented a preliminary diskfile type for special formats. Turrican
       boots up correctly (crashes if I want to play a game, though).
       Implemented EHB and added a few missing masking operations in the color
       handling.
       Fixed the absw addressing mode - need to sign extend here as well.
951025 Fixed another extremely stupid bug, this time in the playfield code.
       Each pixel was calculated four times...
       Increased the size of the apixels array - this was being overrun.
951024 Fixed an extremely stupid bug in flag settings for byte and word
       operations.
       The "sectors until gap" field must be in the range 1..11 instead of
       0..10, or very bad things will happen if it is used to calculate a
       blit size.
951021 Don't use real pointers to fetch bitplane data - too many segfaults.
       Delay the copper after executing an instruction, or wait sequences like
       FFDF FFFE 0200 FFFE won't work.
       Some programs expect that the CPU is completely turned off if the
       blitter nasty bit is set. So be it.
       The RSI Megademo chokes when disk DMA fetches two syncs. Leave one out.
       The LOF bit wasn't set correctly.
951020 Blitter fixes: Load fill carry from FCI each line; keep the masked
       value of bltadat in bltolda
       Give the CPU twice as many "cycles" - this still is not even remotely
       correct, but a better estimate.
951017 Added SVGAlib support. Unfortunately, my graphics card isn't fully
       supported by the current SVGAlib version.
951015 More small optimizations to memory.h and custom.cc.
       Added code for 256 color screens. The type of screen has to be
       selected at compile time.
951014 Modified the memory management to be (hopefully) a little more
       efficient.
       Changed gencpu.cc to generate functions and a big function pointer
       array instead of the old case labels. The generated C++ files now
       compile a lot faster, and the code should be better as well.
951013 Implemented pseudo POTGOR to keep the RMB from being detected as
       pressed all the time.
       GenerateDecTab() generated TRAP incorrectly.
       Made some more instructions (MOVE.B A0,D0 etc) illegal in gencpu.cc.
       Fixed X colors. Fixed data fetching for HiRes screens.
951011 EXT.WL instructions set the flags.
       Implemented second CPU emulator, plus "DualCPU" option. The new CPU
       emulator is generated automatically from a file called table68k by
       a program called gencpu.
951002 Removed version information from the file headers.
       Removed some sillinesses in custom.cc. 
       DSKLEN bug fixed (mask out 0xC000).
       Playfield code rewritten. Now supports horizontal scrolling. Implemented
       some primitive color support.
950927 Fixed predecrement/postincrement addressing with byte size for the
       stack pointer.
950926 Fixes to the disk code: Terminate disk DMA, flip disk side, read more
       than just two sectors during disk DMA, fix checksum calculation.
       Fixed copper comparison bugs.
       
950901 Release 0.1
950826 bugfix in GenerateDecTab(): LEA.W instructions were generated.
950312 New file disk.cc, for (guess what) disk support. Doesn't work yet.
950311 Multiplication instructions were generating 16 bit results.
       Sign extension was wrong in some places.
       Removed bugs in the blitter (one word width: ALWM & AFWM and line mode)
       The Kickstart logo looks perfect now.
       Playfield routine should check BPLCON0 instead of BLTCON0
950309 ASR D8,D0 is not a valid instruction.
       Bitplane pointers were not incremented.
       Copper comparison didn't work. COP2LC and bitplane pointers were written
       incorrectly. Fixed.
       Something that bears a striking resemblance to the familiar Kickstart
       logo now appears in my X window!
950306 ROR used to set the X flag. Bug fixes in GenerateDecTab.
       More bug fixes in several 68000 instructions.
       Improved blitter. ?????? KS1.3 doesn't seem to set BLTDMOD on a 
       line draw. What is this??
       Fixed stupid bugs in playfield code.
950305 fixed bugs in opcode generation and interrupt handling. Implemented 
       STOP. Fixed flag settings: Result wasn't masked. Ooops!!
       ADDQ #imm,An doesn't set flags.
       One-shot timer mode didn't work.
       Implemented blitter, doesn't work.
       Some primitive and slow playfield support, only to make the things that
       hopefully will soon appear visible.
950304 CIA timers ought to work OK. Copper is emulated.
       Emulator loops infinitely when trying to initialize the console.device
950303 experiments with X, figured out how to open a window and draw pixels.
       No graphics emulation yet, though.
950301 Nearly all instructions work.
       Fixed supervisor mode stack.
       The memory manager now handles CIA chips.
950228 Bug fixes in 68000 code, exceptions and more instructions implemented
       Memory management extended to handle custom chips as well.
       Debugger improved.
       Kickstart passes memory & CPU type test, builds up some system
       structures.
950227 MC68000 & little debugger for tracing. It can execute the first couple
       of KS1.3 instructions, but doesn't get past the memory test.
950225 Work begun
